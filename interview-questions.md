# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Allows us to extract values from an array

  Researched answer: Destructuring in JavaScript is a simplified method of extracting multiple properties from an array by taking the structure and deconstructing it down into its own constituent parts through assignments by using a syntax that looks similar to array literals.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: numbers, strings, booleans

  Researched answer: the value of the element, the index of the element, and the array object being mapped.



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object is local and can only be used once while a Class is global and can be used multiple times.

  Researched answer: Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class. Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: Divs are used to group larger chunks of code whereas Span is used for smaller chunks of code.

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: No idea. 
  
  Researched answer: You can use fragments to create components that return a list of elements without wrapping them in a container or array. This is useful for components that return form and text markup — as wrapping the result in a container <div> can cause headaches when styling things.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Not sure.

  Researched answer: Media queries, fluid grids, flexible images



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming -Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb - Interactive Ruby Shell is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby.
- Instance variable- In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
- Ruby hash- A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
- Class relationships- Classes are interrelated to each other in specific ways. In particular, relationships in class diagrams include different types of logical connections. The following are such types of logical connections that are possible in UML:

Association
Directed Association
Reflexive Association
Multiplicity
Aggregation
Composition
Inheritance/Generalization
Realization
